# ASSESSMENT 3: Career Readiness

The LEARN program focuses on readying our students for a career in technology. The job hunt is a daunting process that requires a lot of preparedness. Complete the following tasks to ensure you are progressing in your professional development.

### Portfolios

Creating a technical portfolio website is a big undertaking. Portfolios are almost never "done" as they will continue to evolve as your experience changes and grows.

Wire frames are used to outline the basic structure of your site. Wire frames should be vague enough to give you flexibility in your development process but structured enough to ensure all appropriate elements are present. 

Submit the link to your wire frames:
